## Homework 1
For this homework assignment, you will be conducting design-space exploration of GEM5 simulator parameters using the CLI tool described in the previous sections, with a focus on the matrix multiplication program (mm.cpp). Your goal is to understand how different cache, reorder buffer, and other parameters impact the performance of the matrix multiplication program in the GEM5 simulator.

To complete this assignment, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you have cloned the GEM5 simulator CLI project and have followed the steps in the "Preparing GEM5" and "Compiling a Binary" sections to set up the environment and compile the mm.cpp binary.

2. Conduct a thorough review of the GEM5 documentation to understand the various parameters that can be set in the simulator. Pay particular attention to the cache and reorder buffer parameters, as well as any other parameters that you think may impact the performance of the matrix multiplication program.

3. To change GEM5 simulator CPU parameters, you can pass in arguments to the run-se script. For example, to change the L2 cache size to 64KB, you can use the following argument before the -b flag (which indicates the binary name is the next argument): --l2_size=64KB.

4. Design an experimental plan to systematically explore the design space of these parameters using the matrix multiplication program. This may involve running the program with different parameter configurations, or comparing the performance of the matrix multiplication program to other programs with different configurations.

5. Use the run-se script to run the matrix multiplication program with the various simulator parameter configurations and matrix sizes specified in your experimental plan. Make sure to record the simulation statistics for each run using the get_statistics.py and process_stats.py scripts.

6. Analyze the collected simulation statistics to understand how the different parameter configurations impact the performance of the matrix multiplication program. You may want to use graphical tools or statistical techniques to visualize and compare the results.

6. Write a report summarizing your findings from the design-space exploration. Your report should include an overview of your experimental plan, a description of the parameter configurations that you explored, and your analysis of the collected simulation statistics. Be sure to clearly explain any trends or patterns that you observed, and offer insights into the impact of different parameters on the performance of the matrix multiplication program.

7. In your report, consider discussing the following questions:

- How does the cache size and associativity affect the performance of the matrix multiplication program?
- How does the reorder buffer size impact the performance of the program?
- How do other parameters, such as the memory system configuration, affect the performance of the program?
- Do the trends observed in your analysis align with what you expected based on your understanding of computer architecture principles?
- Are there any unexpected results that you observed? Can you explain them based on your understanding of the GEM5 simulator and the matrix     multiplication program?

Submit your report and any relevant code or data as part of your homework submission.

Note: This is just one example of a homework assignment for design-space exploration using the GEM5 simulator CLI tool with the matrix multiplication program. You may need to modify or adapt this assignment based on the specific goals and requirements of your course.
